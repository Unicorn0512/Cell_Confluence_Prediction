# Cell Confluence Predictor

The **Cell Confluence Predictor** is a tool developed based on the Random Forest Regression algorithm for predicting cell growth.

## Modeling Description
We have trained a model for predicting cell growth using the Random Forest Regression algorithm. The model was modeled using nearly 3900 growth curves obtained from different cell lines under various treatment conditions. It demonstrated an R-squared value of 0.957 on the test set.

## Software Manual
Due to file size limitations, we have moderately simplified the model to create `Cell_Confluence_Predictor.exe` for reference. By inputting the cell growth confluence data for the first four days, the tool can predict the growth for the next four days and perform a growth curve fitting. For detailed instructions on using the Cell Confluence Predictor tool, please refer to the `Cell Confluence Predictor Instructions.pdf`.

## Code Availability
We have uploaded relevant computer codes, including data cleaning, parameter tuning, and performance evaluation. However, the data supporting the findings of this study are not publicly available due to privacy or ethical restrictions. If you are interested in the data, please contact me via email.
